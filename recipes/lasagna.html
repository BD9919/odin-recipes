    <p>
      The assembled lasagna should take about 50 minutes to cook in an oven
      preheated to 375 degrees F. Cover it with foil for the first 25 minutes,
      then let it cook uncovered for the final 25 minutes. Also, it's important
      to let the lasagna rest at room temperature for about 15 minutes before
      you cut into it.

    <p>
      You can use the microwave to reheat lasagna if you're in a pinch or short
      on time, but be aware that it will change the texture of the noodles. The
      best way to reheat lasagna is in the oven. Simply cover the leftovers with
      foil and bake at 350 degrees F for about half an hour, or until it's
      heated through and the sauce is bubbly.
